# Kubernetes

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Manual deployment of Containers is hard to maintain, error-prone, and annoying
* Containers might crash/go down and need to be replaced
* We might need more container instances upon traffic spikes
* Incoming traffic should be distibuted equally

Kubernetes allow us to have
* Automatic deployment
* Scaling & Load Balancing
* Management of containers

This is achieved with a **Kubernetes configuration**

*Kubernetes is like Docker-Compose for multiple machines*

### Pod

A Pod (Container) is the smallest possible unit in Kubernetes. A pod can hold one container or many containers.

### Worker Node

Worker Nodes run the containers of your application

"Nodes" are your machines/virtual instances

Worker Nodes have a *Proxy/Config*
