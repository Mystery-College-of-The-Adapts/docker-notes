# Kubernetes

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Manual deployment of Containers is hard to maintain, error-prone, and annoying
* Containers might crash/go down and need to be replaced
* We might need more container instances upon traffic spikes
* Incoming traffic should be distibuted equally

Kubernetes allow us to have
* Automatic deployment
* Scaling & Load Balancing
* Management of containers

This is achieved with a **Kubernetes configuration**

*Kubernetes is like Docker-Compose for multiple machines*

### Pod

A Pod (Container) is the smallest possible unit in Kubernetes.

A Pod hosts one or more application containers and their resources (volumes, IP, run config)

Pods are created and managed by Kubernetes via the Master Node

### Worker Node

Worker Nodes run the pods of your application

"Nodes" are your machines/virtual instances

A Worker Node contains:
* Pods
* A **kubelet** which communicates between the Master and Worker Node
* A **kube-proxy** which handles incoming and outgoing traffic

### Master Node

The Master Node controls your deployment (i.e. all Worker Nodes)

The Master Node contains *The Control Plane*

The Control Plane is various components which help with managing the Worker Nodes

A Master Node (Control Plane) contains:
* An **API Server** which is the API for the kubelets to communicate with
* A **Scheduler** which watches for new Pods, selects Worker Nodes to run them on
* **Kube-Controller-Manager** which watches and controls Worker Nodes, correct number of Pods, and more
* **Cloud-Controller-Manager** which is like the Kube-Controller-Manager but for a specific Cloud Provider. It knows how to interact with Cloud Provider resources

### Cluster

A Cluster contains your master node and all the worker nodes

A Cluster is one network
