# Production

### Things Out Watch Out For
* Bind Mounts shouldnt' be used in Production
* Containerized apps might need a build step (i.e. React apps)
* Multi-Container projetcs might need to be split (or should be split) across multiple hosts/remote machines
* Trade-offs between control and responsibility might be worth it
